Analysis of the MacOs `LogitechWebcamComponent` Framework and Hardware.
The disassambly was done by IDA and can  be found in the IDA folder.

## `LogitechWebcamComponent` Analysis: <br>

### Functions/ Exports:

#### VCInterface_: 
Video Control Interface
Resembles the standard Video Control Interface for basic configurations and oprerations with the camera.
Logitech's 

#### ACL_ Interface: Bluetooth Protocol:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_video_device_class

ACL is part of the Bluetooth operations/ protocol stack and is exclusively used to transport data. The opposit to ACL is sco,which is mainly used for Voice Communication (or data and voice combined) and does not offer retransmissions.
It can be seen as the Video Control Interface for Bluetooth



The ACL_ methods provide basic operations to handle Bluetooth Device management and basic control commands

#### LAC_, LACCM_:

depend on ACL flags and objects.  Offer methods for Bluetooth data and device management.

#### LVCMM_, LVC_, LVUVC_, LogiUVC_ Interface:
Logitech Video Control Manager, Logitech Video Controller, Logitech Video Universal USB Controller, Logitech USB Video Class

LVCMM_, LVC which handle basic device event management and video format,resolution configuration. LVUVC_ handles video device get/set methods.

The LogiUVC_ methods implement camera device discovery/ scanning.
The USB video device class (also USB video class or UVC) is a USB device class that describes devices capable of streaming video like webcams, digital camcorders, transcoders, analog video converters and still-image cameras.
The latest revision of the USB video class specification carries the version number 1.5 and was defined by the USB Implementers Forum in a set of documents describing both the basic protocol and the different payload formats

### Import functions:

#### IOKit, Core Media IO, Core Video Framework:

Logitech Core API implements methods from the IOKit Framework to manage low lvl communication with the webcam. To handle data streams and basic configuration apples CoreMediaIO (CM)Framework is use. 
For further Video(data) stream operations Logitech utalizes Apples Core Video Framework (CV).

## Hardware:

The PCB of the webcam consists of 5 main components, which are the camera, the microphone, a microcontroller, a quarts, an eprom.
All of those main components are connected to the microcontroller, the eprom is propably used as buffer for imgs and the qurts to synchronize video frame rate.  
The diode, responsible for the indication light is connected to ground via. a transistor which is connecterd to a onboard IC. 

## Indicator Light Bypass:

Since the indicator LED is more or less directly connected to the microcontroller and their is no indication of direct LED control through the software drivers on the computer(the analysed Logi techWebcamComponent), It can only be assumed that the LED is controlled by the firmware on the on board microcontroller.
Also, there are no big data chunks in the analysed code, which could contain the firmware and would give us control over the IC firmware, which would be a powerfull attack vector.  
In summary it can be assumed that, their is no immediate obvious or easy to exploit issue in the software stack concept.
